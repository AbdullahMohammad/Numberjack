Easy:
=====
006 Finished before (Numberjack examples)
007 Finished
015 Finished
023 Finished
024 Finished before (Numberjack examles)
025 Finished
041 Finished
049 Finished
054 Finished before (Numberjack examples)
057 Finished

Moderate:
=========
002 None
009 In-progress - for some reason it's giving unsatisfiable.
012 Needs constraint implementation - http://sofdem.github.io/gccat/aux/pdf/consecutive_groups_of_ones.pdf
014 None
018 None - has a model but I did not undestand it. Look into "classical planning problems"
020 None
021 In-progress - inefficient model / rewrite
028 Finished before (Numberjack examples)
031 None
033 None - should be easy, but I am not sure about the specification
034 Finished before (Numberjack examples)
036 None - how is this a CP problem? it seems to be asking for the minimum Hamming distance between strings?
044 In-progress - should work but giving unsatisfiable
050 Finished
055 Finished
056 In-progress - Stuck: How to constraint nodes to be on the same ring?

Difficult:
==========
001 In-progress - Getting unsatisfiable for some reason
003 None - there is a model but both it and the problem description is confusing
004 None - there is a model; but I did not really understand it
005 None - there is a model but this is confusing
010 None - there is a model but I do not understand the part where it assigns golfers in different groups on different weeks
011 None - there is a model but it seems somewhat complicated; needs time
013 None - there is a model but it's not really helping me in how I should approach the problem
016 None - did not really understand what the solution is that we are looking for
017 None
019 Finished 3/4 variants - last one needs constraint implementation http://sofdem.github.io/gccat/aux/pdf/alldifferent_consecutive_values.pdf
022 None - did not really understand what the solution should be
026 None
027 None - should be possible to copy the model
029 None - should be fairly simple, but how do we add "soft contraints"?
032 None - should be possible to copy the models
035 None - did not really understand what is required
037 None - not sure how to make a "planning" model in NJ
038 None - should be possible to copy the model
039 None - should be fairly easy once I find out how to solve "minimization" problems in NJ
040 None - minimization problem
043 None
045 None - how to decode binary arrays into decimal numbers in NJ?
046 None
047 None - seems complicated; needs time
048 None - seems complicated; needs time
052 None - not sure how to find "maximal" solutions
